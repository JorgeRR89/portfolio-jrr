    industry: "Mobility, Supply Chain & Optimization"
    type: "Time Series Forecasting"
    impact_type: "Cost & Efficiency"
    status: "Completed"
    year: "2025"

    skills:
      - Demand forecasting
      - Time series feature engineering
      - Model evaluation & backtesting
      - Operational analytics

    tools:
      - Python
      - pandas
      - scikit-learn
      - matplotlib

    outcomes:
      - "Hourly demand forecasting with feature engineering (lags/rolling/calendar)"
      - "Time-aware train/test split (past → future)"
      - "RMSE evaluation + ops-friendly interpretation"

    problem: "Operations need reliable short-horizon demand forecasts to plan driver capacity efficiently."
    approach: "Resample/clean time series → build lag/rolling/calendar features → train baseline + ML models → evaluate with RMSE on a future holdout."
    results: "Improved forecast stability and produced an ops-friendly evaluation view for peak-hour staffing decisions."
    details: "Built as a reproducible notebook workflow with clear plots and metrics."
