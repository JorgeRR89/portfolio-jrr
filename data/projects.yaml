    title: "Taxi Demand Forecasting — Sweet Lift"
    tagline: "Time-series demand forecasting for hourly rides; ops-ready features and evaluation."
    spotlight: true

    industry: "Mobility, Supply Chain & Optimization"
    type: "Time Series Forecasting"
    impact_type: "Cost & Efficiency"
    status: "Completed"
    year: "2025"

    skills:
      - Demand forecasting

    outcomes:
      - "Hourly demand forecasting with feature engineering (lags/rolling/calendar)"
      - "Error analysis by time-of-day and seasonality"
      - "Reusable training + evaluation pipeline"

    problem: "Operations need reliable short-horizon demand forecasts to plan capacity efficiently."
    approach: "Feature engineering (lags/rolling/calendar) + baseline/ML models + rigorous evaluation."
    results: "Improved forecast stability and produced an ops-friendly evaluation view."
    details: "Built as a reproducible notebook workflow with clear plots and metrics."

  techniques:
    - "Created lag/rolling window features to capture short-term demand momentum"
    - "Added calendar features (hour, day-of-week) to model seasonality"
    - "Compared baseline vs ML model to keep interpretability"

  evaluation:
    - "Time-based split to avoid leakage"
    - "MAE/RMSE for overall error"
    - "Error slices by hour/day to identify where the model fails"

  reasoning: "I chose this approach because operations needs a forecast that is stable and explainable. Feature engineering + baselines gives robustness; time-aware evaluation prevents misleading performance."
