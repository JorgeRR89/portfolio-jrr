    skills:
      - Demand forecasting
      - Time series feature engineering
      - Model evaluation & backtesting
      - Operational analytics

    tools:
      - Python
      - pandas
      - scikit-learn
      - matplotlib

    outcomes:
      - "Hourly demand forecasting with feature engineering (lags/rolling/calendar)"
      - "Time-aware train/test split (past → future)"
      - "RMSE evaluation + ops-friendly interpretation"

    problem: "Operations need reliable short-horizon demand forecasts to plan driver capacity efficiently."
    approach: "Resample/clean time series → build lag/rolling/calendar features → train baseline + ML models → evaluate with RMSE on a future holdout."
    results: "Improved forecast stability and produced an ops-friendly evaluation view for peak-hour staffing decisions."
    details: "Built as a reproducible notebook workflow with clear plots and metrics."

    github_user: "JorgeRR89"
    github_repo: "Visi-n-Artificial---Supermercado-Good-Seed"
    cover: "assets/projects/good_seed_cv.png"

    skills:
      - Computer vision pipelines
      - Deep learning with CNNs
      - Transfer learning (ResNet50)
      - Data augmentation & preprocessing
      - Model evaluation & error analysis
      - Applied AI for operations

    tools:
      - Python
      - NumPy
      - pandas
      - TensorFlow / Keras
      - matplotlib

    outcomes:
      - "Built an age-estimation model from facial images using transfer learning"
      - "Reduced MAE from ~17.4 → ~11.0 years with stable convergence"
      - "Designed a deployable vision pipeline with GPU-efficient training"
      - "Delivered operational framing for safe AI-assisted age verification"

    problem: "Retail operations involving age-restricted products rely on manual verification, creating friction, inconsistency, and legal risk."
    approach: "Preprocess and augment images → use pretrained ResNet50 as feature extractor → add dense regression head → train with MAE loss and Adam optimizer → apply EarlyStopping and LR scheduling → evaluate MAE/MSE and error behavior."
    results: "Final validation MAE ≈ 11.05 years and MSE ≈ 191.3, demonstrating a stable deep learning system capable of supporting automated age estimation with human-in-the-loop validation."
    details: "GPU training (~35 minutes on NVIDIA T4). Architecture: ResNet50 + GAP → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(1). Dataset split 80/20 with ImageDataGenerator and ImageNet preprocessing."
